# Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier

This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

The script implements a CNN with six layers, trains it on the Fashion MNIST dataset, makes predictions for two test images, and saves the trained model. This code can be adapted to classify user profile images for targeted marketing in a future project.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x (Keras is included with TensorFlow 2.x)
- Other Python packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Installation
